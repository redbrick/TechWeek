However, Aoife quickly runs into scaling problems: those models have to handle tens of thousands of requests per second for both learning and prediction, there are billions of different features in so much data, and all the while she wants models to stay up to date and run lots of them to figure out which ones make the best predictions. Let's follow Aoife as she begins with the simplest possible system and explore ways in she might design the system to overcome these scaling issues."
