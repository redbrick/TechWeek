With the machine learning mathematics all done, shouldn't it be easy: just train the model and make predictions? Not so fast. We'll see how Aoife overcomes the obstacles that stand between her machine learning model and the world. For starters: she has to train it on petabytes of data, continually arriving, and have it serve millions of predictions a second. Graham Poulter is a Site Reliability Engineer on Google's machine learning pipelines for ads, having moved here from South Africa three years ago. He's done some machine learning before, but was amazed to see that scaling up machine learning is a whole lot harder than one might imagine."
