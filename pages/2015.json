Every year, AWS outpace the previous year in launches and are continuously accelerating the pace of innovation across the organization.\n Network Engineer at Amazon Dublin, long-time redbrick favourite, and holder of many patents Colin Whittaker returns again to share some Internet related knowledge. Colin has presented to redbrick many times over the years and is returning to share how teams in AWS are able to formulate customer-centric ideas, turn them into features and services, and get them to market quickly. This session dives deep into how an idea becomes a service at AWS and how we continue to evolve the service after release through innovation at every level. We will then walk through some real-world examples of how we applied these concepts to launch a new AWS service. Come learn about the rapid pace of innovation at AWS, and the culture that formulates magic behind the scenes."
